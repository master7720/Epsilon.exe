# [ info ]
Just over a year ago, the lead developer made the decision to release Epsilon to the public.([original repo]([(https://github.com/SpartanB312/Epsilon))) However, at that time, no one had the expertise to operate or troubleshoot the system. This challenge persisted until today when a solution was finally found.
